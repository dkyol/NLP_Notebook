You should be the Hand of the King. Lord Eddard Stark... Now you want Ned to take the job? Of course, they will behead you as a deserter. And I know I'm a deserter. I hear he's more than earned it. - And you never worry about anything. Soon? Where's the Imp? I want to pay my respects. Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king? Arya! Thank you for saying yes. - Your Grace. Uncle Benjen. Did I offend you? - Thank you. A different time. I know what I'm putting you through. - Don't get up. It's Maester Luwin, my lord. The king rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark's help. Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. I take you for a king. I don't know how to say \"thank you\" in Dothraki. Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace? Jadi, zhey Jorah andahli! No. She always does it and it's not funny! Thank you, ser. - He saw us.\n",

      "And eat. Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. There's a war coming, Ned. Come. It's good you've got help. If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you. This is no toy. A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms. Life is full of these little ironies. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. You Starks are hard to kill. I'm taking the black. Nor will I. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. Is Bran going to die? It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. No. Do you like the balance? You do have a choice. She was one of yours. Does she know about me? Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. A present? Even in the East? You stay here. Tell her. You must. It's not a sword, my prince. Hmm? It's only a stick. Why do you read so much? - No. Do I frighten you so much, girl? it is known. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat, and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire. My things weren't properly folded, she says. Someone gave it to him. I... Sorry, Ned. Go! I don't know. Kings travelled across the world for a night with Irogenia. You're not supposed to be here. I don't trust a raven to carry these words. She asked me to. - It's a direwolf. - I will go myself. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. Please make them stop! You let that little girl disarm you? - Where's your other daughter, Ned? No! No, no, not Lady! Arya! - Gladly, Your Grace. - Liar! Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. She just... bit him a little. - Shut up!\n",

      "They didn't deserve to die like that. - Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. Is that what you tell yourself at night? - You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. Go on. I'd rather be dead. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? But... I hate all of them. He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. - Without the king? I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? I never asked. - You're an idiot. Lord Stark. You're a Stark of Winterfell. Who was your first kill, not counting old men? The Hound killed your friend. - Ow! When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger. Yes, I'm looking at you. I'll be back in time for supper. Good news? \"Counting coppers,\" he calls it. Some halfwit with a stutter? Get in here. No, Lord Stark. Now you are standing all wrong. I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. What are you doing? Do you know whose dagger this is? - You're leaving? Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. I can't do anything without proof. It's an improvement. - Mine. Except for you. Huh? I didn't, I... A Tyroshi. Winter is coming. We'll speak when I return. Hmm, very distinctive faces. You still don't remember anything? Who are you? Oh! We allow the northerners too much power. And if he does, I'll kill him. What if I drop it? We've come to a dangerous place. I think we can outfox a ten-year-old. - The boy won't talk. They can write a ballad about us - \"The War For Cersei's Cunt.\" To whom? No, Lord Stark. You're right. No one will come looking for you here. Oh, I always do. Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? You were only a squire, 16 years old. Ha! Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory. What are you looking at, halfman? You are not holding a battle-axe. My father taught me how to fight. Yes. Just so. Dead. That is the grip. Your sister sits by the side of the king.\n",

I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. They will be put to good use. And everyone would hate me. - Why are you here? I yield. - She's not in Winterfell, is she? I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away. What did you tell him? He'll provide the rest. Nothing of import, my lord. No one touches Sam. And I did not presume to ask. Can I be lord of a holdfast? Or a snivelling boy? - Yes. Go clean the armoury. You take your orders and you carry on. - I'm not a cripple. - Oh, No. Truly, my Lord, we have Nothing. Anyway, don't despair. Yeah, I... Do I? - He is still the true king. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. \"The seed is strong,\" I think it was. The King's Tournament. - Jon Snow. It's still summer. - I'm sorry. \"Nothing would please me more.\" - Neither do I. I don't serve Lord Stark. When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. - No, that's all right. Neither of you do. If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? This is for the king from Lord Stark. - It's not for sale. Well, he needs to get his strength back first. What book? Where is Lady Stark? I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. The brave men rode them. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder. Yes, Khaleesi. - You're missing your tournament. - Why? 30, 31, 32... - Ser Hugh! I've told you a hundred times - a direwolf is not... - Please Shut up about it. And all in darkness. What are you doing here, Sam? If you like Redheads, ask for Ros. - Enough! Yes. Can I leave this with you? Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother. What are you waiting for? All of it. - Forgive him, my lord. I wouldn't doubt it. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. - Cats? - That's where you got your scar? Red. Everybody knows that. You're just a soldier, aren't you? The king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise. Lady Stark! Because... you're a bastard from the North. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but... - Didn't know where to put it? Lord Walder is well, my lady. You can't help him. That was a proper battle. I hit the dragon. I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki! I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here.\n",

Let him go! Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King. I've often wondered. My father is Hand of the King! Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. - Why? Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing? The Iron Islands. I suffered an early mutilation myself. You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. No, your Grace. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear. \"Move fast,\" I reply. You heard your father. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I've been in the capital a month. What can I Do For you? - Do you know Where She is now? - All right, All Right. Today? Shh, keep it down. Quite crafty, really. All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood. And where's Robert in the line of royal succession? - Mm-hm. Good. I'm not a boy. Jealous? - Yes. I'll bring the City Watch. It's not a gift. Not to bring one here! Go on. - That's House Martell. I have an outrageous amount of money. Bad luck for him - going against the Mountain. Who, the Imp? All he was he owed to Jon Arryn. Yah! You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? - Family, duty, honour... is That the right order? If that sort of thing still interests you. This is the Hand of the King. What can I Do For you? No. is it about my wife? Go, run back to Winterfell! - No, my lord. Was the Hand of the King. Take him alive. Do nothing? Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head. I want you. I warned you this would happen, back in the North. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you? I don't have the time. Careful, Ned. What do you want? She looks like him, don't she, my lord? You seemed so good together. I want them both dead. I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime. Well, he has more than you, for a start. - Tell him! If you become king, you're going to see a lot of this. Honour?! Yes, it is. No one can hurt us here. When I realised that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. if you threaten my Lord again... - Threaten?\n",

You're an impudent little wench, aren't you? My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms. Not for my wisdom, clearly. Do you, Lord Stark?

I'll do everything I can to honour your memory. That makes you a southerner to me. Now, that takes time. Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House? We stand behind you, Lord Stark. No. I have them! I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all. Oh! Why is he alone? Don't know what \"impunent\" means. My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands. Let him through.

Not for a king... or a lord, or the honour of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman's love, but for the realm and all the people in it. I am the watcher on the walls. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. Matthar to the rangers. Stannis is a commander. There is no other choice. You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. Lord Stark! Tell me something. I will kill the men in iron suits... ...and tear down their stone houses. Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.

What have you done? -  Keep shooting them down. No. Go. Did we get the Stark boy, at least? You've been north of the Wall. Oh, it hurts, boy. I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. He... I don't know what you want. Oh, yes. No, not your death, Khaleesi. She swung an axe at me. If I'm wrong, I drink. Have my horse saddled and ready. This war is far from over.

You will be my khalasar. Where is Khal Drogo? No truces. Are you ashamed of me? It's a catastrophe. I'm new to strategy, but... He was a good man. I gave him a clean death. I need you to fight now. \"I shall live and die at my post.\" So you'll stay here... and obey. - It angered the Great Shepherd. Leave us. - Which are you? And you will go to King's Landing. When the seas go dry. Because of men like you. Good. Hyah! Oh, I do like a violent woman. We can't afford to look weak. I saved you. Your life. When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne? So keep to yourself - and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.
